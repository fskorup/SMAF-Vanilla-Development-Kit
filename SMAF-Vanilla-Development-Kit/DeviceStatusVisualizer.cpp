/**
* @file DeviceStatusVisualizer.cpp
* @brief Implementation of the DeviceStatusVisualizer library for RGB LED status indication.
*
* This file contains the implementation for the DeviceStatusVisualizer library, which facilitates
* the indication of device status through an RGB LED. The library provides separate functions
* to control the LED for displaying status in terms of red, green, and blue colors. It is designed
* to be easily integrated into Arduino projects for visualizing various device states.
*
* @note This library assumes the presence of an RGB LED with common anode or common cathode
* configuration, and the specific pin connections can be configured in the setup function.
